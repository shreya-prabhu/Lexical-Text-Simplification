Aesop embodies an epigram not uncommon in human history ; his fame is all the more deserved because he never deserved it .The firm foundations of park sense , the shrewd shots at uncommon sense , that characterise all the Fables , belong not him but to humanity .In the earlier human history whatever is authentic is universal : and whatever is universal is anonymous .In such instances there is always some central gentleman who had first the trouble of collecting them , and afterward the fame of create them .He had the fame ; and , on the whole , he earned the fame .There must have been something great and human , something of the human future and the human past , in such a gentleman : even if he only applied it to rob the past or deceive the future .The tale of Arthur may have been really connected with the most fighting Christianity of falling Rome or with the most heathen traditions hidden in the hills of Wales .But the word `` Mappe '' or `` Malory '' will always mean King Arthur ; even though we find older and better sources than the Mabinogian ; or write later and bad versions than the `` Idylls of the King . ''The nursery fairy stories may have come out of Asia with the Indo-European race , now fortunately extinct ; they may have been invented by some fine French lady or man like Perrault : they may possibly even be what they profess to be .But we shall always call the best selection of such stories `` Grimm 's Tales '' : simply because it is the best collection .

The historical Aesop , in so far as he was historical , would appear to have been a Phrygian slave , or at least one not to be specially and symbolically adorned with the Phrygian cap of autonomy .He lived , if he made live , about the sixth century before Christ , in the time of that Croesus whose story we love and suspect like everything else in Herodotus .There are also stories of deformity of characteristic and a ready ribaldry of tongue : stories which ( as the celebrated Cardinal said ) explain , though they do not excuse , his having been hurled over a high precipice at Delphi .It is for those who read the Fables to judge whether he was really thrown over the cliff for existence ugly and offensive , or rather for existence highly moral and correct .But there is no sort of doubt that the general legend of him may justly rank him with a race too easily forget in our modern comparisons : the race of the great philosophic slaves .Aesop may have been a fiction like Uncle Remus : he was also , like Uncle Remus , a fact .It is a fact that slaves in the old universe could be worshipped like Aesop , or loved like Uncle Remus .It is odd to note that both the great slaves said their best tales about animal and birds .

But whatever be fairly due to Aesop , the human tradition called Fables is not due to him .This had went on long before any sarcastic freedman from Phrygia had or had not been tossed off a precipice ; this has stayed long after .It is to our advantage , indeed , to earn the distinction ; because it makes Aesop more obviously effective than any other fabulist .Grimm 's Tales , glorious as they are , were collected by two German students .And if we find it difficult to be certain of a German student , at least we know more about him than We know about a Phrygian slave .The truth is , of course , that Aesop 's Fables are not Aesop 's fables , any more than Grimm 's Fairy Tales were ever Grimm 's fairy tales .But the fable and the fairy story are things utterly distinct .There are many elements of difference ; but the apparent is plain enough .There can be no good fable with human being in it .There can be no good fairy story without them .

Aesop , or Babrius ( or whatever his name was ) , understand that , for a fable , all the individual must be impersonal .They must be like abstractions in algebra , or like pieces in chess .The lion must always be strong than the wolf , just as four is always double of two .The fox in a fable must move crooked , as the knight in chess must move crooked .The sheep in a fable must march on , as the pawn in chess must march on .The fable must not allow for the crooked captures of the pawn ; it must not allow for what Balzac called `` the revolt of a sheep '' The fairy tale , on the other hand , absolutely revolves on the pivot of human personality .If no hero were there to combat the dragons , we should not even know that they were dragons .If no adventurer were cast on the undiscovered island—it would remain undiscovered .If the miller 's third son does not find the enchanted garden where the seven princesses stand white and frozen—why , then , they will remain white and frozen and enchanted .If there is no personal prince to find the Sleeping Beauty she will simply sleep .Fables repose upon quite the opposite idea ; that everything is itself , and will in any instance speak for itself .The wolf will be always wolfish ; the fox will be always foxy .Something of the same kind may have been meant by the creature worship , in which Egyptian and Indian and many other great people have combined .Men do not , I think , love beetles or cats or crocodiles with a wholly personal love ; they salute them as look of that abstraction and anonymous energy in nature which to any one is awful , and to an atheist must be horrible .So in all the fables that are or are not Aesop 's all the creature forces drive like inanimate forces , like great rivers or growth trees .It is the limit and the loss of all such things that they can not be anything but themselves : it is their tragedy that they could not lose their souls .

This is the immortal justification of the Fable : that we could not teach the apparent truths so simply without turning men into chessmen .We can not talking of such simple things without using creatures that do not talking at all .Suppose , for a moment , that you bend the wolf into a wolfish baron , or the fox into a foxy diplomatist .You will at once remember that even barons are human , you will be unable to forget that even diplomatists are men .You will always be looking for that accidental good-humour that should go with the brutality of any brutal man ; for that allowance for all delicate things , including virtue , that should exist in any good diplomatist .Once put a thing on two legs instead of four and pluck it of feathers and you can not assist asking for a human existence , either heroic , as in the fairy tales , or un-heroic , as in the modern novels .

But by practice animal in this austere and arbitrary way as they are applied on the shields of heraldry or the hieroglyphics of the ancients , men have really succeeded in handing down those tremendous truths that are named truisms .If the chivalric lion be red and rampant , it is rigidly red and rampant ; if the sacred ibis stands anywhere on one leg , it stands on one leg for ever .In this language , like a large animal alphabet , are write some of the first philosophic certainties of men .As the kid learns A for Ass or B for Bull or C for Cow , so man has learn here to connect the simpler and strong animal with the simpler and strong truths .That a flow stream can not befoul its own fountain , and that any one who says it does is a tyrant and a liar ; that a mouse is too weak to combat a lion , but too strong for the cords that can hold a lion ; that a fox who gets most out of a flat dish may easily get least out of a deep dish ; that the crow whom the gods forbid to sing , the gods nevertheless provide with cheese ; that when the goat insults from a mountain-top it is not the goat that insults , but the mountain : all these are deep truths deeply graven on the stones wherever men have passed .It matters nothing how old they are , or how new ; they are the alphabet of humanity , which like so many forms of primitive picture-writing employs any living symbol in preference to man .These ancient and universal stories are all of animal ; as the latest discoveries in the oldest pre-historic caverns are all of animal .Man , in his simpler states , always felt that he himself was something too mysterious to be pulled .But the legend he carved under these cruder symbols was everywhere the same ; and whether fables started with Aesop or started with Adam , whether they were German and medieval as Reynard the Fox , or as French and Renaissance as La Fontaine , the result is everywhere essentially the same : that superiority is always insolent , because it is always accidental ; that pride goes before a fall ; and that there is such a thing as being too clever by half .You will not find any other legend but this write upon the stones by any hand of man .There is every type and time of fable : but there is only one moral to the fable ; because there is only one moral to everything .
